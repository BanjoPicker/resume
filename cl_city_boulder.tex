I am writing to apply for the Java Senior Software engineer position with the City of Boulder.

During the past 6 years with Qualstar Corporation, I acquired a broad skillset 
that makes me an ideal candidate for this position.  I am involved with every aspect of web application 
development with Java.  As the sole maintainer of a web application used in a piece of IT equipment, I am 
in charge of client-side development, server-side development, nightly builds and deployment 
of the application.  Also, my doctorate degree in mathematics shows that I am capable of working independently 
and learning new concepts quickly.

Enclosed is my current resume.  Also, I maintain a personal server as a hobby that has 
other information about me at:

Please let me know if there are any other materials or information that will assist you in processing my application.

Thank you for your time and consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you.
