I am writing to apply for the Senior Java Software Engineer position posted on jobindublin.com.

During the past 6 years with my current employer, I acquired a broad skillset 
that makes me an ideal candidate for this position.  I am involved with every aspect of web application 
development with Java.  As the sole maintainer of a web application used in a piece of IT equipment, I am 
in charge of client-side development, server-side development, nightly builds and deployment 
of the application.  In addition, we use Apache Tomcat so I have extensive experience configuring and 
deploying applications with Tomcat.  I am also familiar with RESTful web services as I have written 
a REST application from scratch as well as used the Apache Struts REST capabilities and also have exerimented with 
Sun's JSR 311 (Jersey) implementation. 

Although I am currently residing in the U.S., I am looking to move to Europe as I have a family member there.  
Ideally, I would look for a 1 to 3 year agreement.

Enclosed is my current resume.  Also, I maintain a personal server as a hobby that has 
other information about me at:

\url{http://timmy.TransientRants.com}

Please let me know if there are any other materials or information that will assist you in processing my application.

Thank you for your time and consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you.
