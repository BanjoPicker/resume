I am interested in a full-time Senior Software Engineering position focused on server side development 
in either C/C++ or Java in a Linux environment.

During the past six years with my current employer, I acquired a broad skillset 
that makes me an ideal candidate for such a position.  I am involved with every aspect of web application 
development with Java as well as Linux system programming in C/C++.  As the sole maintainer of a web 
application used in a piece of IT equipment, I am in charge of client-side development, server-side development, 
nightly builds and deployment of the application.  

In addition to an in-depth understanding of software, several years of teaching mathematics at the college level 
show that I can effectively communicate technical ideas to others.

Enclosed is my current resume.  Also, I maintain a personal server as a hobby that has 
other information about me at:

Feel free to send me an email if there are any specific questions to be addressed.
